# createContext and useContext

Context allows us to communicate props in a component tree without the need to manually pass them through props.

When to use Context?

- A UI Theme (light theme, dark theme, etc).
- User authentication.
- Preferred language.

But it is not limited to the above examples.
In other words, Context is not required to handle a "global state" of the application, although it is very useful for these scenarios.
